![alt text](https://github.com/asharahmed/income-inequality-visualization/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This Python code reads in data from a CSV file and filters it to keep only relevant rows. It then pivots the DataFrame to put the years in columns, and plots the data using a bar chart.

## Requirements
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries using pip:
`pip install pandas matplotlib`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Save the `income_data.csv` file in the same directory as the Python code.
3. Run the code using your preferred Python environment.
